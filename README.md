# Neuro-Pilot

**Neuro-Pilot** is a JavaScript-based self-driving car simulation project that demonstrates the implementation of a neural network without relying on external libraries. This project covers various aspects of autonomous driving, including car mechanics, road definition, sensor simulation, collision detection, and neural network optimization.

## Features

- **Car Driving Mechanics**: Basic controls and movement functionalities.
- **Road Definition**: Environment setup and road layout.
- **Artificial Sensors**: Simulation of sensors to gather environmental data.
- **Collision Detection**: Mechanism to detect and respond to collisions.
- **Traffic Simulation**: Simulated traffic to mimic real-world driving conditions.
- **Neural Network**: A neural network to control the car's behavior.
- **Visualization**: Tools to visualize the neural network and its learning process.
- **Optimization and Fine-Tuning**: Techniques to enhance the neural network’s performance.
